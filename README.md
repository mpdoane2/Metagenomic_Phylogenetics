This is a respository for scripts used to navigate WoLtka output for generating files for plugging into iCAMP

These scripts allow you to parse a large reference tree (nwk format) from, say, the WOL: Web of Life (https://biocore.github.io/wol/) on a per-sample basis or for all identified units (OTU, ASV, or OGU).
